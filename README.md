# Sleep-Stage-Classification

A research project on classifying sleep stages of patients with supervised machine learning.

# Highlights

* Utilized Python Pandas and Pickle libraries for digital signal processing on dataset of 340 million measurements to smooth data with filtering, extract information for feature vectors and apply dimensionality reduction algorithms 

* Achieved multiclass sleep stage classification accuracy of 77.21% with convolutional neural network (CNN) and 68.24% with K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) algorithms implemented in Python with SciKit and TensorFlow libraries

## Repo Information

This repo is a brain dump from my machine learning project as part of the Drexel University ECEC 487 - Pattern Recognition
course. The repo is divided into the following folders.

### Root Directory

The main directory of this project includes my research paper as well as the presentation. This provides a complete overview of the project.

### Scripts

The scripts directory contains the Python Jupyter Notebook Scripts that execute the code. Most of it was a "fast and dirty" approach and requires some refactoring; however, most scripts contain detailed comments on what each line does.

### Models

The data we used has been "pickled". This is useful for reproducing our results, but not useful in improving feature extraction from the initial data.
